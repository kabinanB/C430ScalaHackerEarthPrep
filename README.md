# Scala Prep — MCQs & Coding Challenges

This repository contains solutions for the **Scala preparation task**, which includes:

1. **Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs)** on Scala fundamentals and intermediate concepts  
2. **Coding Questions** based on common interview problems

The goal is to practice Scala syntax, OOP concepts, recursion, collections, higher-order functions, pattern matching, and problem-solving with Scala.
